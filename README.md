## Technologies

Describe the technologies required to use your project such as programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and operating systems. Be sure to include the specific versions of any critical dependencies that you have used in the stable version of your project.

This is a pretty standard python project. Some deps worth mentioning:  
- fire(0.4.0): google library to accept command line arguments. This doesn't actually utilize this functionality,
           but it's still in here for some unknown reason.  
- questionary(1.10.0): library to prompt user to input data  
- csv: to read / write csv data.
